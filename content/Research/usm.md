#### Research Intern | [Universitäts-Sternwarte München](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität | March 2025 - Present 

#### Mentor: [Dr Til Birnstiel](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/contact-page/til-birnstiel-abb3ee27.html), Professor 

The N-body simulations were made using the Python package [REBOUND](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

- Developed and executed N-body simulations to investigate the gravitational collapse of a dust cloud in the presence of a central star and a pre-existing (collapsed) gas disk, focusing on the interaction between stellar gravity and disk-induced forces on gas drag. 

- Modeled coupled dust–gas dynamics during protostar formation by integrating particle trajectories with hydrodynamic fields, using snapshots from [Tarā](https://plg.physlab.uni-due.de/tara-database/) simulations to temporally and spatially interpolate local gas density, velocity, and temperature. This approach allowed for a faster computation of particle trajectories compared to hydrodynamics simulation performed in [2024, A&A, 687, A158](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...687A.158B/abstract)

- Communicated complex research insights for a broader audience through Astrobites articles, summarizing the group’s findings in an accessible and engaging manner while maintaining scientific accuracy.
