#### Research Intern | [National Centre for Radio Astrophysics](https://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/) - TIFR | September 2022 - July 2023

#### Mentor: [Dr Yashwant Gupta](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/people/Academic_FacultyPage?oid=249), Center Director and Professor 

- Developed Python scripts for folding and binning time-series data to generate pulsar profiles from uGMRT observations of the Crab Pulsar.

- Implemented C routines to define on/off gates, enabling precise separation of pulsar on-pulse and off-pulse emission intervals.

- Applied pulsar timing, dedispersion techniques, and correlator analysis, utilizing software tools such as TEMPO2 and GMRT Pulsar Tool (gptool).

- Gained hands-on experience with radio telescope instrumentation, including antenna systems, back-end electronics, and control room operations through regular visits to the GMRT facility.

- Explored advanced pulsar analysis topics including folding, dedispersion, and time-domain signal processing, bridging computational methods with observational radio astronomy.
