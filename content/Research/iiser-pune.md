#### Bachelor Thesis | [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/) | July 2023 - May 2024

#### Mentor: [Dr Deepak Dhar](https://www.psa.gov.in/article/india-focus-prof-deepak-dhar-honoured-boltzmann-medal/4219), Professor Emeritus 

The project was inspired by Exercise 8.13 in the book ["Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity"](https://sethna.lassp.cornell.edu/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity20.pdf) written by James P. Sethna.

- Built a strong theoretical foundation in statistical mechanics and phase transitions through comprehensive study of standard texts.

- Developed a Python simulation of a 1D zero-temperature random field Ising model to investigate discrete magnetisation jumps in ferromagnetic materials containing impurities and defects.

- Quantitatively analysed the effects of lattice size, random field standard deviation, and probability distributions on magnetisation curves, identifying parameter-dependent behaviours and trends.

#### Few Results:

Figure (Top) is the H vs M curve for a 1-D lattice with a random Gaussian field of R = 3.1.  
Figure (Bottom) is the H vs M curve for different lattice sizes. Both plots are outputs from the simulation.
