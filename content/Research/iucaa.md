#### Summer Intern | [Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA)](https://www.iucaa.in/en/) | Jun 2023 - Jul 2023

#### Mentor: Mr Ashish Mhaske, Scientific and Technical Officer 

- Led a student team to measure 21-cm neutral hydrogen emission across different Galactic longitudes using a conical horn antenna.

- Obtained the Milky Way rotation curve by analyzing Doppler-shifted HI line profiles.

- Gained hands-on experience with radiometer operation, backend electronics, and HI line fundamentals.

- Designed and implemented a Python data-analysis pipeline to process source and calibration data.

- Determined the most red-shifted velocities of HI clouds, bridging observational techniques with computational analysis.
